# SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis Project

Welcome to the SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis Project repository! This project, conducted using the R programming language, aims to investigate the genetic diversity and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants across different countries. By analyzing genomic sequences of the virus obtained from various regions, we seek to uncover insights into its evolution, propagation, and potential impact on different populations.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find code and documentation related to the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences using R. The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1 - Video Analysis

In Part 1, we address key questions related to SARS-CoV-2 and its impact. We explore the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in the world, examine coronaviruses reported in other species, and reflect on strategies for managing the pandemic in low-resource communities. This part includes a video presentation discussing our findings and recommendations.

### Part 2 - R Script Analysis

Part 2 focuses on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences using the R programming language. We selected the option to analyze sequences from the 20 countries with the highest reported cases to explore the diversity of virus variants between different populations. The R script provided in this repository calculates sequence lengths, generates a graphical comparison of DNA base counts, and performs a global hierarchical analysis of the selected sequences. Our goal is to visualize genetic relationships and draw meaningful conclusions about the virus's spread.
